# KtValid8

## Purpose

This is a String Validation library written in Kotlin. It is mostly just my first attempt in writing Kotlin

## Setup

This project itself is not runnable, but it does contain a gradle build used to run the JUnit tests. I would highly recommend using IntelliJ IDEA to work with this code. All code is compatible with the Community Edition, as that is what I use to develop Kotlin.

## Dependencies

* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
* [JUnit 4](https://junit.org/junit4/)
